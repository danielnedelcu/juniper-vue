# challenge
Create a single page application in VueJS to view thumbnails of products, allowing user to click on a single
product to view full product details. We are looking for a simple and clean design with a focus on the product
images. The layout must be responsive and work well on all devices (desktop, tablet, phone). The completed
project should be visibly appealing as well as technically sound.


This is the list of products for the user to be able to navigate through. Please show ItemID, ItemName,
Description, Dimensions, and BasePrice. We use imageresizer (see above) so you can make thumbnails by
appending query string parameters to the URL of the photoname property.
